# YAAI-recreation-in-python

This project is a playful recreation of the infamous early‑2000s prank program **“You Are An Idiot”**, rewritten in Python using Tkinter and Python.  

The script spawns multiple windows that:
- **Bounce around the screen** like ricocheting balls  haha get it
- **Flash between black and white** backgrounds for maximum chaos (**EPLILEPSY WARNING**)
- **Contain bouncing text and buttons** that refuse to stay still xd
- **Multiply endlessly** whenever you try to close them  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is intended for educational and entertainment purposes only. Don’t run it on systems where you need stability — it will quickly overwhelm your desktop! Unless you want to burn your pc lmao
